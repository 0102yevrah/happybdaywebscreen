# Happy Birthday Customizer

A simple web page that allows you to dynamically customize a birthday greeting and footer message. Users can change the name in the greeting message and modify the footer by typing specific commands.

## Features:
1. **Change Name**: Type `change name` to reveal an input box where you can type a custom name. The name you enter will update the heading to "Happy Birthday [Name]!".
2. **Change Footer**: Type `change footer` to reveal an input box where you can type a custom footer text. The footer text will be updated accordingly.
3. **Toggle Input Fields**: You can show or hide the input fields by typing the corresponding command again (e.g., typing `change name` will toggle the visibility of the name input box).

## How to Use:

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository:
   - **Clone**: Use `git clone` to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/happy-birthday-customizer.git
     ```
   - **Download**: Alternatively, you can download the zip of the repository by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".

### 2. Open the Web Page:
   - Navigate to the folder where the `index.html` file is located.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

### 3. Customizing the Name:
   - To change the name in the greeting, type `change name` anywhere on the page (in the address bar, the console, or simply by typing anywhere on the page).
   - Once you type the command `change name`, an input box will appear where you can enter a custom name.
   - After typing the name, click the "Submit" button to update the heading. The greeting will change to **"Happy Birthday [Name]!"**.

### 4. Customizing the Footer:
   - To change the footer text, type `change footer` anywhere on the page.
   - Once you type the command `change footer`, a new input box will appear where you can enter custom footer text.
   - After typing the footer text, click the "Submit" button to update the footer.

### 5. Toggling Input Fields:
   - If the input fields are already shown, typing the command (`change name` or `change footer`) again will hide the input fields.
   - This allows you to toggle the visibility of the input fields as needed.

### Example Walkthrough:
1. Type `change name` to open the name input box.
2. Type in a name (e.g., "Alice") and click "Submit".
3. The greeting heading will change to **"Happy Birthday Alice!"**.
4. Type `change footer` to open the footer input box.
5. Enter your custom footer message (e.g., "Have a blast!").
6. The footer will update with the new text.
